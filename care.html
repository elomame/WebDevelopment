<h2>Caring for your Cockatiel</h2>

<hr>

<h3> Housing</h3>

<p>Cage requirements must meet at least the following:</p>

<p>Size</p>
<blockquote>Size must be large enough to provide ample spacing for the cockatiel's wing span and full body height including tail feather length.
We recommend a cage at least 24" x 18" x 24".</blockquote>

<p>Perch</p>
<blockquote>The cage must be able to support a perch with the minimum diameter of 5/8". We recommend a perch with a diameter anywhere between 5/8" and 1-1/4" to provide the bird with sure footing.</blockquote>

<p>Detachable Flooring</p>
<blockquote>As we all know cockatiels are just like any other bird - they can be very messy. Detachable flooring is very important because it makes cleaning the cage much easier. Simply cover the flooring with old newspaper or another disposable surface covering and replace as necessary.
</blockquote>

<h3> Food</h3>

<p>A healthy balance of nutrition is vital to your cockatiel's livelihood. This might include:</p>

<p>Main Diet</p>
<blockquote>As some might believe, a cockatiel's primary diet consists of seeds, but a healthier diet actually might include calcium in the form of rich, leafy vegetables or dairy products such as yogurt and some cheese. Avoid dairy products with lactose, as cockatiels have no means of digesting it. A healthy amount of protein is also recommended, such as from freshly cooked fish or chicken..</blockquote>

<p>Cuttlebones</p>
<blockquote>Cuttlebones make excellent additions to any cockatiel housing. They provide your bird with an excellent source of calcium as well as an abundant amount of entertainment.</blockquote>



<h3> Toys</h3>

<p>Cockatiels need fun too! Some examples of toys might include:</p>

<p>Bells</p>
<blockquote>Bells make a charming addition to any bird cage. Cockatiels will occasionally peck at the bell, resulting in a happy little chime. They provide hours of entertainment to your bird.</blockquote>


<p>Chew Toys</p>
<blockquote>Cockatiels are very destructive by nature. In order to appease their nearly insatiable desire to destroy everything in their path, try sacrificing a variety of chew toys to your cockatiel such as cuttlebones, natural foliage, or your math homework.
